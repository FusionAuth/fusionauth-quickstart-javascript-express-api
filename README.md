# Quickstart: Express.js API Resource Server with FusionAuth

This repository contains an application that works with a locally-running instance of [FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io/), the authentication and authorization platform.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/): Presumably you already have this on your machine if you are looking at this project locally; if not, use your platform's package manager to install git, and `git clone` this repo.
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 18 or later.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com): For standing up FusionAuth from within a Docker container. (You can [install it other ways](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/), but for this example we will assume you are using Docker.)

### FusionAuth Installation via Docker

The root of this project directory (next to this README) are two files [a Docker compose file](./docker-compose.yml) and an [environment variables configuration file](./.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```
docker compose up -d
```

The FusionAuth configuration files also make use of a unique feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart): when FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the [Kickstart file](./kickstart/kickstart.json) and mimic API calls to configure FusionAuth for use when it is first run.

> **NOTE**: If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by docker-compose by executing `docker-compose down -v`.

FusionAuth will be initially configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is: `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`
* Your client secret is: `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your fusionAuthBaseUrl is 'http://localhost:9011/'

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you don't need to.

### complete-application

The `complete-application` directory contains a minimal app configured to authenticate with locally running FusionAuth.

Install the dependencies and run the app with
```
cd complete-application
npm install
npm run start
```

The app is now serving two api endpoints
 - [http://localhost:3000/make-change](http://localhost:3000/make-change) - this endpoint calculates the change to make from a given total
 - [http://localhost:3000/panic](http://localhost:3000/panic) - this endpoint simulates notifying the police of an incident.

You can login with a user preconfigured during Kickstart, `teller@example.com` with the password of `password` and `applicationId` by calling:

```sh
curl --location 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/login' \
--header 'Authorization: this_really_should_be_a_long_random_alphanumeric_value_but_this_still_works' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "loginId": "teller@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "applicationId": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e"
}'
```
